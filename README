To test intially we used spot checking, 
creating text files to test certain properties 
of the wrap algorithm. We checked to make sure 
line width stayed <= the given width to wrap. 
We checked to make sure words too big were put 
on their own line. We also checked to make sure
paragraphs had a maximum of two "\n" characters 
between them and that there weren't paragraphs
breaks at the start of a file or the end.

We also checked the directory functionality. Only 
regular files within the directory were wrapped. 
Making sure subdirectories of a given directory 
weren't read or any file that began with "wrap.". 

After simple checking of certain properties was
done we tested large files from online. Cross-checked
our results with another groups results to confirm
the same output was recieved.
